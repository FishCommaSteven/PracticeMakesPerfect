Design a Book class.

If you minimal knowledge of requirments could you design a Book class 
that would would most likely work in any scenario that came up during
requirements clarification?

The only information you have is that the book class will be used in a
reader type of application. 

That is enough to start and even implement a class if you are strict and
methodical...
