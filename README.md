# PracticeMakesPerfect
Practice makes perfect is a collection of examples, interview style questions, experiments, etc.

You can use any language you like. If you see a "problem" you'd like to try, just create a subfolder
and name it whatever works for you.

If you have a problem, experiment, etc you like to share with the group, just add a folder fot it with a 
README.md file with details.

Have fun!
